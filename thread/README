C++ class 'thread' is an abstract base class that encapsulates
functionality for creating and managing threads (Pthreads).

Derived classes must implement the pure virtual functions:
 * setup
 * execute
 * cleanup
These functions will be executed from the context of a thread
that is unique for each created object of the derived class.
