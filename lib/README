Example of how to create a library component written in C++.
The library (libio) doesn't perform any real work, but is an
example/demonstration of various techniques.

The sample library can be generated as:
1. Static library (.a)
 or
2. Shared library (.so), dynamically linked
Both variants can be built using optimization(release) or not(debug).

A test application, written in C, is included to test and show
usage of the library.
