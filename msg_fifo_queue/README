Template C++ class 'msg_fifo_queue' implements a FIFO queue
for arbitrary classes. Based on C++ STL deque class and provides
protection by Pthread mutex and condition variable.

Typical usage is by one pair of threads acting as producer/consumer
but many consumer threads can also be used. Consuming threads wait
until the queue has some elements.
