C/C++ support that allows the calling thread to sleep in Linux.

The code is based on 'clock_nanosleep' and tries to make use of one of the
following clock identifiers: 
 CLOCK_MONOTONIC
 CLOCK_REALTIME

CLOCK_MONOTONIC is unaffected by any manual adjustments of the system clock.
But it is affected by the incremental adjustments performed by NTP.

The code uses flag TIMER_ABSTIME to sleep until an absolute time. This is
done to avoid the need of repeatedly recalculating time to sleep.
