C++ class 'timer' encapsulates functionality for time measurement in Linux.

The class is based on 'clock_gettime' and tries to make use of one of the
following clock identifiers: 
 CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
 CLOCK_MONOTONIC
 CLOCK_REALTIME

CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW is unaffected by any NTP- or manual adjustments of
the system clock. This clock identifer may not be available on all systems.
