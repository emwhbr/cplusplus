C++ class 'fifo_queue' implements a simple FIFO queue that shall
be used by one pair of threads acting as producer/consumer.

The queue is protected by semaphores. This makes it impossible
to 'put' data when queue is full or 'get' data when queue is empty.
Calling threads will be blocked until queue is stabilized. Non-
blocking behaviour is also possible by using proper flags.
